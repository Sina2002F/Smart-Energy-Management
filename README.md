**Smart Energy Management System**  
A web-based application designed to monitor, manage, and optimize energy consumption (electricity, gas, and water) in smart homes or buildings. This system allows users to track energy usage in real-time, view detailed reports, and receive personalized recommendations to reduce energy consumption and costs. Built with a focus on sustainability and efficiency, this project combines backend data processing with an intuitive frontend interface.

**Key Features**:
- Real-time energy consumption tracking.
- Device management (e.g., lights, heaters, pumps).
- Energy usage reports and analytics.
- AI-powered recommendations for energy savings.
- User-friendly dashboard for monitoring and control.

**Technologies Used**:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js or Vue.js)
- **Backend**: Python (Flask/Django), Node.js
- **Database**: MySQL, PostgreSQL
- **APIs**: Energy data simulation or integration with IoT devices.
